                        In the Word Puzzle you have to figure out the correct word by a mess of shuffled letters. 
                        The longer the word the more points you can score. However be sure to think before you type! 
                        Any deleting will result in a decreased score.<br/>
                        You will have {{secondsPerGame}} seconds to solve as many word puzzles as possible.
